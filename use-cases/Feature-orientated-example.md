Using the OGC API-Features compatible aspects of EDR API:
1.    Give me all traffic lights along my route;
2.    Give me all houses below my flight path;
3.    Give me all seabed sediment sample data within a given radius of a position. 

An alternative, more sophisticated query:
1. Give me the state of all traffic lights along my route;
2. Give me the current energy consumption of houses below my flight path;
3. Give me the shear strength and bulk density of the seabed within a given radius of a position.
